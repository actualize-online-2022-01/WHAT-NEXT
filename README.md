# Where to go from here!

![What now?](https://media.makeameme.org/created/sooo-what-now.jpg)

It can be hard to know how to keep practicing once the bootcamp is over! We’ve spent the last two weeks exclusively working on our Capstone projects, and we spent the four weeks before that planning them But…now what?! It’s essential to keep practicing not only your whiteboarding skills, but also your language and frameworks skills too! And the best way to do that is by working on projects that interest YOU.

An added benefit of working on coding projects is that you can (and should!) add them to your portfolio and to your resume. A lot of students have a hard time with this though - I know I did! What should I build? Where should I start? I definitely had assistance on my capstone project, and I was unsure of what I could accomplish on my own!

Well, the first thing to realize is that, even though you’ve graduated from the bootcamp, you’re not on your own! There is a HUGE community of Actualize graduates you have access to, including Actualize tech leads that are available to you when you need them. I’m also available! While I may not be as responsive as I was during the program, PLEASE don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you’re struggling with what to do or where to go next. We can have a conversation and make a game plan to get you on track. BUT in the meantime, here is a collection of project ideas to keep you inspired and working towards a robust portfolio:


## 1. Build on your Foundations:

#### [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/)
**30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge** - by *Wes Bos*
Wes Bos is a Fullstack JavaScript developer and host of the excellent [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) podcast (definitely worth a listen!) His free course will take you through learning some of the VERY cool things you can accomplish with Vanilla Javascript, and they make great portfolio projects! 

#### [Ruby 30](https://courses.alexgama.io/course?courseid=ruby-coding-challenges-course)
**30 Ruby Coding Challenges in 30 Days** - by *Alex Gama*
Designed to help you imporve your Ruby coding skills, the 30 Ruby Coding Challenges are less "project" based and more geared towards helping you improve your foundational Ruby knowledge!

## 2. Work on your personal website!

Now’s the time to work on your personal website to make it the best it can be! What does this mean? Spend some time combing through your personal website to make sure:

 - All spelling is correct
 - All the links work (remove any you don’t need!)
 - There’s no dummy text (aka lorem ipsum)
 - There are no sections with empty content, blank photos, or broken code
 - REMEMBER: less is more - don’t add content to just “add content”. Make it work for you!  
Some examples:
- [https://www.caseycantrell.com/](https://www.caseycantrell.com/)
- [https://patricknikolaus.github.io/](https://patricknikolaus.github.io/)
- [https://ikarabulut.github.io/](https://ikarabulut.github.io/)
- [https://www.katevansdev.com/](https://www.katevansdev.com/)  (*My site is RIDICULOUSLY plain and simple - it doesn’t need to be long and/or flashy, simple websites are better than larger ones with useless or incomplete content!*)


## 3. Keep working on your capstone project:

I know that, for almost all of you, there are aspects of your capstone projects you haven’t finished yet. **Keep working on them!!**

I ALSO know that this can be a daunting suggestion, since you’ve just lost your daily accountability (i.e. class), and your ready access to TA and instructor assistance. But fear not! You have access to the Actualize alumni network, your TIP instructors, and Actualize Tech Leads (you’re free to schedule sessions with them any time you’d like). You can also use each other as a resource! When working on your capstones, you should never be “stuck” - if you get stuck and spend more than 30-45 minutes researching solutions to no avail, move on to another task and contact someone for assistance. This will also help you become a more self sufficient developer and help you hone your “googling skills” and your error message reading skills. (Google and StackOverflow are your friends)

An fun, alternate approach:
*Rebuild your capstone with a different technology! Try building your frontend using React! Try building your backend using PHP or Python. This is a great way to start with something you know and incorporate something new.*

Lastly, publish your capstone project on Heroku and Netlify!

## 4. Work on something new! 
Don’t have any idea what to build? I gotchu! Here are some ideas for projects to work on:

## Backend Applications (APIs - no frontend!)
I struggled to put together ideas for backend APIs - there's a good chance I fill this in more in the coming days/weeks, but for now I will leave this section relativley bare. SO many companies these days build their business models around APIs as a product. Think about Twilio - they have a very robust codebase that users like us are able to connect to via API calls. (**API** stands for Application Programming Interface). The backends that we build in Ruby on Rails were APIs! You wrote a bunch of code that your front end was able to connect to to retrieve or effect data. Many of you also connected to external APIs for your capstone projects! 

If you're at all interested in building out backend applications (i.e. APIs that either you or others can access) I encourage you to read more about what it means to build a good API.  

- [How to build an API](https://rapidapi.com/blog/20-tutorials-on-how-to-create-your-own-api-sorted-by-programming-language/) (in multiple languages!)

- How to (conceptually) [build an API](https://www.mindk.com/blog/how-to-build-an-api/)

## Frontend Applications (no backend!)

*(Please note, some API will require you to create a backend to make your API calls)*

#### Build A Weather app!
___
Using the frontend framework/library of your choice, connect to a [weather API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#weather) and build out the following capabilities:

 - A route/page for the Daily Forcast
 - A route/page for the Weekly Forcast
 - An "About Page" that talks about the technology used and how you build the project. 
 - **Bonus:** create routes for polution/air quality and/or pollen count using an [environment API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#environment)

This app should allow the user to input their location (zipcode/city/address, etc) to retrieve the daily/weekly forecast relevant to them. *And make it look nice!*

 - Include different CSS and JavaScript elements to show different images based on the weather: i.e. if it’s sunny, show an image of a sun/sunny day, if it’s raining, show rain, etc, etc

#### Build a Dictionary/Thesaurus app!
___
Using the frontend framework/library of your choice, connect to a [dictionary API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#dictionaries) and build out the following capabilities:

- Allow the user to search for a word's definition, include a search bar that allows the user to input the word they’re looking to define.
- Show the user synonyms and antonyms for a word, i.e. similar/opposite words based on the user’s search parameters.
- Create a route/page that shares a *"Word of the Day"*!
- An “About” page that talks about the technology you used and how you build your project
- **Bonus:** Include the word's pronunciation - show the user the correct pronunciation, and include an audio clip!
- **Bonus:** show the user the word in different languages!

#### Build a currency converter/exchange app!
___
Using the frontend framework/libray of your choice, build an **SPA** (single page application) that connects to a [currency API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#currency-exchange) and allow the user to compare one or more currencies by entering a starting amount for a particular currency. *Make it your own!*

#### Build a Cryptocurrency application!
___
Using the frontend framework/library **AND** JavaScript charting library of your choice, build an **SPA** (single page application) that connects to a [cryptocurrency API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#currency-exchange) and allow the user to compare one or more currencies by entering a starting amount for a particular currency. *Make it your own!*


#### Dealer's Choice! 
___
There are so many great (read: FREE) APIs available, I encourge you to spend some time looking through a few of these resources to find some inspiration: 

- [apilist.fun](https://apilist.fun/)

- [Public APIs on Github](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
