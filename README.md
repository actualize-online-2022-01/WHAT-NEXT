# Where to go from here!

![What now?](https://media.makeameme.org/created/sooo-what-now.jpg)

It can be hard to know how to keep practicing once the bootcamp is over! We’ve spent the last two weeks exclusively working on our Capstone projects, and we spent the four weeks before that planning them But…now what?! It’s essential to keep practicing not only your whiteboarding skills, but also your language and frameworks skills too! And the best way to do that is by working on projects that interest YOU.

An added benefit of working on coding projects is that you can (and should!) add them to your portfolio and to your resume. A lot of students have a hard time with this though - I know I did! What should I build? Where should I start? I definitely had assistance on my capstone project, and I was unsure of what I could accomplish on my own.

Well, the first thing to realize is that, even though you’ve graduated from the bootcamp, you’re not on your own! There is a HUGE community of Actualize graduates you have access to, including Actualize tech leads that are available to you when you need them. I’m also available! While I may not be as responsive as I was during the program, PLEASE don’t hesitate to reach out to me if you’re struggling with what to do or where to go next. We can have a conversation and make a game plan to get you on track. BUT in the meantime, here is a collection of project ideas to keep you inspired and working towards a robust portfolio:


## 1. Build on your Foundations:

#### [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/)
**30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge** - by *Wes Bos*
Wes Bos is a Fullstack JavaScript developer and host of the excellent [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) podcast (definitely worth a listen!) His free course will take you through learning some of the VERY cool things you can accomplish with Vanilla Javascript, and they make great portfolio projects! 

#### [DevProjects]([https://courses.alexgama.io/course?courseid=ruby-coding-challenges-course](https://www.codementor.io/projects/ruby))
**This is a new website I found and I LOVE it so far - super cool**
Designed to help you imporve your Ruby coding skills and your project scope and management skills, these are awesome projects to add to your portfolio and ways to stay sharp with Ruby!

#### [Awesome Interests](https://github.com/actualize-online-2022-05/awesome-interests)
Keep working on cultivating your awesome interests in tech! Pick a project to work on, find a new tutorial for something you've always wanted to learn, explore different areas of tech to see if it sparks new interests in you. Just keep learning! 

## 2. Work on your personal website!

Now’s the time to work on your personal website to make it the best it can be! What does this mean? Spend some time combing through your personal website to make sure:

 - All spelling is correct
 - All the links work (remove any you don’t need!)
 - There’s no dummy text (aka lorem ipsum)
 - There are no sections with empty content, blank photos, or broken code
 - REMEMBER: less is more - don’t add content to just “add content”. Make it work for you!  
Some examples:
- [https://www.caseycantrell.com/](https://www.caseycantrell.com/)
- [https://patricknikolaus.github.io/](https://patricknikolaus.github.io/)
- [https://ikarabulut.github.io/](https://ikarabulut.github.io/)
- [https://www.katevansdev.com/](https://www.katevansdev.com/)  (*My site is RIDICULOUSLY plain and simple - it doesn’t need to be long and/or flashy, simple websites are better than larger ones with useless or incomplete content!*)


## 3. Keep working on your capstone project:

I know that, for almost all of you, there are aspects of your capstone projects you haven’t finished yet. **Keep working on them!!**

I ALSO know that this can be a daunting suggestion, since you’ve just lost your daily accountability (i.e. class), and your ready access to TA and instructor assistance. But fear not! You have access to the Actualize alumni network, your TIP instructors, and Actualize Tech Leads (you’re free to schedule sessions with them any time you’d like). You can also use each other as a resource! When working on your capstones, you should never be “stuck” - if you get stuck and spend more than 30-45 minutes researching solutions to no avail, move on to another task and contact someone for assistance. This will also help you become a more self sufficient developer and help you hone your “googling skills” and your error message reading skills. (Google and StackOverflow are your friends)

An fun, alternate approach:
*Rebuild your capstone with a different technology! Try building your frontend using React! Try building your backend using PHP or Python. This is a great way to start with something you know and incorporate something new.*

Lastly, publish your capstone project on Heroku and Netlify!

## 4. Work on something new! 
Don’t have any idea what to build? I gotchu! Here are some ideas for projects to work on:

## Backend Applications (APIs - no frontend!)
I struggled to put together ideas for backend APIs - there's a good chance I fill this in more in the coming days/weeks, but for now I will leave this section relativley bare. So many companies these days have built their business models around APIs as a product. Think about Twilio - they have a very robust codebase that users like us are able to connect to via API calls. (**API** stands for Application Programming Interface). The backends that we built in Ruby on Rails were APIs! You wrote a bunch of Ruby code that your frontend was able to connect to, to retrieve or effect data. Many of you also connected to external APIs for your capstone projects! 

If you're at all interested in building out backend applications (i.e. APIs that either you or others can access) I encourage you to read more about what it means to build a good API.  

- [How to build an API](https://rapidapi.com/blog/20-tutorials-on-how-to-create-your-own-api-sorted-by-programming-language/) (in multiple languages!)

- How to (conceptually) [build an API](https://www.mindk.com/blog/how-to-build-an-api/)

## Frontend Applications (no backend!)

*(Please note, some API will require you to create a backend to make your API calls)*
___
#### Build A Weather app!

Using the frontend framework/library of your choice, connect to a [weather API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#weather) and build out the following capabilities:

 - A route/page for the Daily Forcast
 - A route/page for the Weekly Forcast
 - An "About Page" that talks about the technology used and how you build the project. 
 - **Bonus:** create routes for polution/air quality and/or pollen count using an [environment API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#environment)

This app should allow the user to input their location (zipcode/city/address, etc) to retrieve the daily/weekly forecast relevant to them. *And make it look nice!*

 - Include different CSS and JavaScript elements to show different images based on the weather: i.e. if it’s sunny, show an image of a sun/sunny day, if it’s raining, show rain, etc, etc

___
#### Build a Dictionary/Thesaurus app!

Using the frontend framework/library of your choice, connect to a [dictionary API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#dictionaries) and build out the following capabilities:

- Allow the user to search for a word's definition, include a search bar that allows the user to input the word they’re looking to define.
- Show the user synonyms and antonyms for a word, i.e. similar/opposite words based on the user’s search parameters.
- Create a route/page that shares a *"Word of the Day"*!
- An “About” page that talks about the technology you used and how you build your project
- **Bonus:** Include the word's pronunciation - show the user the correct pronunciation, and include an audio clip!
- **Bonus:** show the user the word in different languages!

___
#### Build a currency converter/exchange app!

Using the frontend framework/libray of your choice, build an **SPA** (single page application) that connects to a [currency API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#currency-exchange) and allow the user to compare one or more currencies by entering a starting amount for a particular currency. *Make it your own!*

___
#### Build a Cryptocurrency application!

Using the frontend framework/library **AND** JavaScript charting library of your choice, build an **SPA** (single page application) that connects to a [cryptocurrency API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#currency-exchange) and allow the user to compare one or more currencies - include a graph for each crypto to show it's price history. *Make it your own!*

# The Job Hunt

I think we can all agree that job hunting suuuuuuuuuuuuucks. Hard. It can feel like rejection after rejection or yelling into an unanswering void. And it's definitely hard to stay positive and active during this process! THEN once you get an interview with a company, they come at you with the technical portion which can be anything from a simple algorithm problem to solve, to a test designed for a senior software engineer, to a full stack app they expect you to build in a week... woof. 

And while I can't promise you a job by a certain date, what I CAN promise is that if you don't give up, you WILL get a job in tech, and it will be worth it. In the meantime, I'm here to commiserate with you and help in any way I can! Right off the bat, here are some of my favorite sites for looking for jobs (this is by NO means a comprehensive list): 

[Angel List](https://angel.co/) - where I got my first programming job! This site is definitely geared more towards startups which can mean a few things: 
 
 1) They're looking for more senior-level talent
 2) They're is less time/opportunity for mentorship with a lean startup team
 3) Money might not be as great (my first SWE job paid me $60k)

Some pros though: 
 1) Sure they might WANT a senior engineer, but they can't afford one - so they hire a junior engineer who's a fast learner! 
 2) speaking of learning - you'll learn a LOT, really quickly. 

[Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) - where I found my second job! GOOD NEWS everyone, while it's a pain in the ass to find your FIRST job in software, each job after that gets exponentially easier. Once I had a year of programming under my belt, I was able to find a job in 2 weeks. And I found it on indeed! I love their quick apply feature which is part of what I attribute to me getting a job (just blasting tons of resumes lol)

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) - LinkedIn is one of the premier ways to find a job, and a lot of people I know have had great success on this platform. As we all know, it's also a great networking site and a place for you to join other developer communities and grow your professional network. 

[BuiltIn](https://builtin.com/) - Built In has a lot of great features, and there are even offshoots of this site, like BuiltIn Chicago, BuiltIn San Francisco, etc. I love this site because each job posting is very clear about what technology they use, company history, the main duties of the role, and what perks/benefits the company offers! They also have a really nice filter/sort section that allows you to search for very specific jobs. 

![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/dm2hi135m/image/upload/v1662668448/Screen_Shot_2022-09-08_at_2.56.09_PM_cxwtv2.png)


Some key search terms for software jobs:
'software engineer', 'software developer', 'jr. software engineer', 'jr. software developer', 'developer', 'jr. developer', 'web developer', 'jr. web developer'

Other search terms: "Technical Support Engineer", "QA Engineer"

### Advice I've followed in the past that's paid off (and hopefully still will!): 

- Tailor your resume to the job posting! Do they use specific key works/skill descriptions in their job posting? Find a way to work some/as many as you can into your resume or cover letter! 

- Reach out to individuals who currently work at said company - DON'T ask for a job, ask about what it's like working for that company, what their day-to-day looks like, how they continue to grow in their role, etc. This way, you're building a relationship with someone at the company rather than asking them to go out of their way to help you, a stranger. If it's a good conversation, 8 times out of 10, they'll ask if you're interested in a role at their company or offer to pass your resume along to the hiring manager!

Ask questions! Remember, to a certain degree, you're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you! It's so beneficial in your first tech role to have good guidance and mentorship, and so it never hurts to ask about that. When you get an interview with a company, it's a great idea to have questions prepared in the event that you're asked "do you have any questions for us?" Here are some questions that I've asked that have served me well: 

"As a junior engineer, I'm working hard to continue learning as much as I can! What resources do you use to keep learning and growing as a software engineer? And what resources did you rely on when you were just starting out?"

"What does a typical day look like for this role?"

"What do the first 60 days look like in this role? The first 6 months?" (chances are the answers will differ significantly! And this helps you determine what kind of onboarding support/guidance is offered to new hires)
